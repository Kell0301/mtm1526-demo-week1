    We put the <script> tag at the bottom for two reasons:
    1. when the browswer hits a <script> tag it will delay rendering the page.
    so, for usibility, if we put our <script> at the end of the page, it will render faster
    2. if the javascript is executed in the <head>, the <body> won't be rendered yet
    so we won't be able to update our html
